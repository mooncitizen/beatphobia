## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Guideline 3.1.2 - Subscription Pricing Display

### **Problem:**
The monthly calculated pricing ($4.99/month) was displayed more prominently than the actual billed amount ($59.99/year).

### **Fix Applied:**
Updated `PaywallView.swift` - PricingCard component:

**Before:**
- Monthly price: 32pt bold (most prominent)
- Billed amount: 13pt secondary text

**After:**
- **Billed amount: 36pt bold** (MOST prominent)
- Monthly equivalent: 13pt secondary text (subordinate)

**Visual Change:**
```
OLD:
Pro Yearly
$4.99/month  ‚Üê Big (32pt)
Billed $59.99 annually ‚Üê Small (13pt)

NEW:
Pro Yearly
$59.99/year ‚Üê Big (36pt)  
Just $4.99/month ‚Üê Small (13pt)
```

**File Changed:** `beatphobia/Pages/PaywallView.swift` lines 476-502

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Guideline 3.1.2 - Missing Terms of Use Links

### **Fix Applied:**
Links are already present and functional in PaywallView:

**Privacy Link:** `https://stillstep.com/privacy`

### **Action Required:**

## ‚úÖ Issue 3: Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Account Deletion

App supports account creation but has no account deletion option.

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Database Function Created:**

- Function: `delete_user_account()`
- Deletes all user data:
  - Community posts, comments, likes, bookmarks
  - Attachments, messages, friendships
  - Profile data
  - Auth user account

**2. UI Added to Profile:**
- New "Delete Account" button (red, prominent)
- Confirmation alert with clear warning
- Explains data will be permanently deleted
- Cannot be undone

**3. Location in App:**
Profile ‚Üí Scroll down ‚Üí "Delete Account" button (above "Log Out")

### **Setup Required:**

## App Review Response Template

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed all three issues:

**1. Subscription Pricing (3.1.2):**
We have updated the subscription purchase flow to display the actual billed amount ($59.99/year) as the most prominent pricing element (36pt bold). The monthly calculated pricing is now subordinate (13pt secondary text).

**2. Terms of Use Links (3.1.2):**
Our app includes functional links to:
- Terms of Use: https://stillstep.com/terms
- Privacy Policy: https://stillstep.com/privacy

These are accessible from the subscription screen and app metadata.

**3. Account Deletion (5.1.1v):**
We have added account deletion functionality. Users can:
- Navigate to Profile tab
- Scroll to bottom
- Tap "Delete Account"
- Confirm deletion in alert dialog
- Account and all data are permanently deleted

The deletion is immediate and permanent, with a clear warning shown to users.

We believe these changes fully address the review guidelines. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Still Step Team

## Notes

- Account deletion uses a Supabase RPC function for secure server-side deletion
- All foreign key constraints are handled (cascade deletes)
- User is immediately signed out after deletion
- No data remains in the database after deletion
