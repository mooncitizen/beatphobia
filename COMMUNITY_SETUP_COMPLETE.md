## 📋 Quick Start Checklist

### Step 1: Set Up Database (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `dktqwcqucsykjayyibuj`

2. **Run SQL Files**
   Navigate to `database/` folder and follow `README.md`:
   
   - ✅ Run `01_community_schema.sql` - Creates tables and triggers
   - ✅ Run `02_rls_policies.sql` - Sets up security
   - ✅ (Optional) Run `03_sample_data.sql` - Adds test posts

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE 'community_%';
   ```
   You should see 7 tables.

### Step 2: Update Profiles Table (Important!)

The community needs user names from the profiles table. Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Ensure profiles table has name column
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS name TEXT;

-- Optional: Set a name for your test user
UPDATE profiles SET name = 'Your Name' WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Step 3: Test the App

1. **Build and run the app** in Xcode
2. **Navigate to Community** from the home screen
3. **Tap "Forum"** to see posts
4. **Tap the pencil icon** to create a new post
5. **Fill out the form** and post!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No posts showing"
- **Check**: Did you run the SQL files in Supabase?
- **Check**: Are you signed in? (Required for RLS policies)
- **Fix**: Run `03_sample_data.sql` to add test posts
- **Or**: Create a post from the app!

### "Error creating post"
- **Check**: Is your `profiles` table set up?
- **Fix**: Run the profile update SQL from Step 2 above

### "Could not decode..."  / JSON errors
- **Check**: Did you run `02_rls_policies.sql`?
- **Check**: Is your Supabase auth working?

### "relation does not exist"
- **Check**: Did `01_community_schema.sql` run successfully?
- **Fix**: Look for errors in Supabase SQL Editor output

## 💡 Development Tips

### Adding Features

The `CommunityService` already has methods for:
```swift
// Ready to use!
await communityService.togglePostLike(postId: post.id)
await communityService.togglePostBookmark(postId: post.id)
await communityService.createComment(postId: post.id, content: "Great post!")
await communityService.fetchComments(postId: post.id)
```

### Testing Locally

1. Use Supabase's built-in Auth UI to create test users
2. Each user can create posts
3. Test RLS policies by switching users

### Monitoring

- Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor to see data
- Use Logs section to debug issues
- Run SQL queries directly to inspect data

---

### Useful SQL Queries

```sql
-- See all posts
SELECT id, title, category, likes_count, comments_count 
FROM community_posts 
WHERE is_deleted = FALSE 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- See who created posts
SELECT p.title, pr.name, p.created_at
FROM community_posts p
LEFT JOIN profiles pr ON p.user_id = pr.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;

-- Check your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- See all tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```
